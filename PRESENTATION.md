## 🎯 **THE CHALLENGE**
NASA asked us to create an **engaging educational game** that uses **real NASA satellite data** to teach farmers sustainable agriculture through **fun, interactive gameplay**.

## 💡 **OUR SOLUTION: FasalSeva**
**"The world's first space-themed farming game powered by live NASA satellite data!"**

We built a **mobile app** where farmers become **space explorers**, learning real agriculture to solve Earth's food problems right now - with space themes to make it fun and engaging!

## 🛰️ **HOW WE USE NASA DATA**

### **Real NASA APIs Power Our Game**
- **NASA POWER API** → Provides solar energy, weather, and climate data
- **MODIS Vegetation Data** → Shows crop health in real-time
- **Weather & Climate Data** → Creates farming challenges  
- **Satellite Imagery** → Makes decisions based on actual Earth conditions

### **It Works Like This:**
```
NASA POWER API + MODIS Data → Our App → Farmer's Phone → Better Crops!
```

**Example:** NASA POWER API shows solar radiation and temperature data for your location, while MODIS shows crop health. When our app detects problems, it teaches you real farming techniques to fix them!
